<p class="text1">When i started?</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">I started coding just before the online class started on August 24, we weren't in class then but I was studying the things I should study and I should learn, I was watching videos of former ICTs to find out what they were doing and also to know what they are studying, but even though I am studying it there seems to be something missing because no one guides me and I also don't know how to save a file and I don't know and different types of file extensions so I'm having a hard time learn code.</li>
	<br>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">Of course at first it was difficult, but when our class started I immediately had an idea on how to start coding, I listened to what the teacher was teaching me but that wasn't enough, I had to study on my own and make what the teacher taught me. our teacher, until I was trained and continued to study until I got to where I am today.</li>
		<br>
	<p class="text1">Is programming difficult?</p>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">there are two kinds of answers I can answer to this question, yes you may have difficulty, why? because if you don't like what you're doing you'll be really hard, if you don't have what you're doing in your heart and you don't like it even if you force yourself to like it, you won't like it because you don't and your heart doesn't want it, you feel that it is not for you, and you may not be too difficult, that is if you like what you are doing and you are willing to continue it as long as you can.</li>
		<br>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">Yes, even if you want it to come and the day will come when you will have a hard time, there is no good opportunity that gets instantaneous, everyone has to suffer, if you like what you do you must be willing to take risks and you are willing to fight for what you want to achieve what you dream you deserve to get if you fight for it.</li>
</ul>
