<p class="text1">Hi, My name is Mark Nicholas Razon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">I am a senior high school student at the colegio de los banos school in the province of laguna, i am a grade 11 student in the ICT (Information and Communication Technlogy) strand. The story when I got the ICT strand was when I was in grade 9 I still didn't know which strand to choose because I wasn't aware of being a senior high school student, I didn't even know that strand/track was called, after many choices and not knew then that there were academic and technical-vocational tracks.</li>
	<br>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">I came in grade 10 still not aware of where I could go, I did not know what path I would take because no one was guiding me, what I knew then was that I would study, I just didn't know anything about others, passing whatever. It's the 3rd quarter of grade 10 but I don't know what I want, when I was a kid I wanted to be a soldier because I was cool, I was holding big guns but as I got older that changed, I thought to myself that I didn't want to be a soldier and another one didn't I'm good there. Until the day came when I could graduate from grade 10 and there were many senior highschoolers who came to our school to say their platforms, while listening to the schools about the strands suddenly mentioned about “ICT” and I suddenly became interested, I listened carefully and analyzed every word spoken by the seminarian with us.</li>
		<br>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">When I came home I immediately researched about "ICT" because I was willing and interested in learning it so I persevered, I am not fond of computers, but I became passionate about coding when I first learned it, I spent time studying until it took a month and I became familiar with codes and various programming languages ​​such as html and css which is where I first learned because it is easy to learn and easy to remember its uses. I filled two notebooks with codes and functions and every day and night I memorized it, when I forgot a code I immediately looked it up in my notebook to find where I went wrong and when I saw a code that was new to me I immediately it will be studied without hesitation.</li><br>
	<li><span style="margin-left: 2%;">Because of this I was trained, I learned to think logic, I learned problem solving and finding fault with what I was doing, I also taught my classmates to increase their knowledge and share with me what I learned, sometimes paid, sometimes not, but for me it's okay because I'm happy here and I'm happy to share knowledge with others.</li>
</ul>
